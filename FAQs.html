            <li>LIC validates the registration data and informs the bank/service provider about the registration status. Since LIC’s database is de-centralized, generally it takes a week’s time for confirmation of registration data.</li>
            <li>A consolidated database of registered policies is maintained by LIC. This database is updated at regular intervals on the basis of changes received from the original servicing branches.</li>
            <li>LIC also sends auto-mailers to the registered policyholders informing the registration status.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: dimgray;">10. When can I pay the insurance premiums?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>On confirmation of the registration, LIC will regularly send the bills/invoices mentioning the due dates, premium amount, late fees, validity date, etc to the service provider/bank.</li>
            <li>As and when premium becomes payable under the registered policy, LIC sends the bills to the bank/service provider, and the information will be displayed by the bank/service provider in your net-banking account page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: dimgray;">11. How to pay the insurance premiums through the banks/service providers?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You have to log on to the bank/service provider’s website.
            <li>On the web page, you have to signify the date on which you want your account to be debited and click the consent for the payment. You may even specify a particular account in case of multiple bank accounts.</li>
            <li>The authorized Bank will debit your bank account, consolidate the payments and send the consolidated amount to LIC in form of bankers’ cheque / payorder.</li>
            <li>The authorized service provider will send the instructions to the bank branch (as mentioned in your mandate form) through the RBI’s Electronic Clearance System and the bank will debit your account and credit the same to the service provider’s bank account, who’ll then remit the amount to LIC.</li>
            <li>Some service providers have autopay facility (where you can issue standing instructions to the service provider to debit your account as when the bill becomes payable), or phone-banking facility (where the you can issue telephonic payment instructions)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: dimgray;">12. How will the payment get accounted under the policy?</h3>

            <li>Through batch processing in Internet module, premium transactions & renewal premium receipts are generated for each policy number.</li>
            <li>Renewal premium receipts for the same are printed and dispatched by ordinary post.</li>
            <li>Premium transactions pertaining to branches other than Branch 883 are sent to the respective servicing branch through the present network programs.</li>
            <li>All unadjusted premium collections are refunded to the Service provider/bank. Emails will be sent to the registered policyholders’ email-ids informing the status of the registrations/payments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: dimgray;">13. What are the important points to be noted for availing this payment facility?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Once registered for Premiums payments through Net-Banking/Phone-Banking, you should avoid paying at cash counters, because there are many instances where payment for the same due-month is received twice.</li>
            <li>Since renewal premium receipts are dispatched to the postal address as per your policy records, please ensure that your policy records are updated with your current address.</li>
            <li>In case you have not received the renewal premium receipt, you may collect the premium paid certificate from the servicing branch of your policy. Duplicate receipts cannot be printed in any case.</li>
            <li>Since we have de-centralized database structure, the collections are not adjusted online, the transaction has to reach the destination servicing branch of your policy for updation of the policy status. Hence there is short time-lag between the date of debit in your bank account and the date when the policy reflects the updated status.</li>
